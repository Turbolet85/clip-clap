# clip-clap

<!-- GENERATED:setup start -->

## Overview
<!-- GENERATED:setup:overview start -->
Minimalist Windows tray utility: hotkey-triggered area-select screenshot, saves PNG to a configured folder, swaps the clipboard to the auto-quoted absolute path so it can be pasted directly into a console (Windows Terminal, VS Code, WSL, SSH).

**Stack:** Go 1.22+ (CGO_ENABLED=0, pure Win32 via `golang.org/x/sys/windows`), TOML config, `log/slog` JSON logs, single static `.exe` for Windows 10/11.

**Key directories:**
- `cmd/clip-clap/` — `main.go` entry point, wires subsystems
- `internal/` — subsystem packages (tray, overlay, hotkey, capture, clipboard, toast, config, log, status)
- `tests/integration/` — pytest + pywinauto Windows UI integration tests
- `scripts/` — `agent-run.ps1` test harness (build/start/status/logs/kill)
- `assets/` — `app.ico`, `app.manifest` (Windows 10/11 compat, per-monitor DPI)

## Purpose
<!-- GENERATED:setup:purpose start -->
A personal-scale productivity tool for developers who frequently share screenshots with terminal-based AI assistants or paste them into chats and docs. The active hotkey-triggered model puts the user in control — no passive clipboard-watching, no false positives. Replaces the multi-step "screenshot → save → find → drag" workflow with a single hotkey + drag.

## Workflow
<!-- GENERATED:setup:workflow start -->
**Key commands:**
- `go build -ldflags="-H windowsgui -s -w" -o clip-clap.exe ./cmd/clip-clap` — production build (CGO_ENABLED=0)
- `go test ./... -cover` — unit tests with coverage
- `pwsh ./scripts/agent-run.ps1 build|start|status|logs|kill` — verification harness
- `pytest tests/integration/` — pywinauto integration tests (requires running agent + UIA)
- `gofmt -w .` — format all Go files

See `.claude/docs/workflow.md` for full development workflow.
See `.claude/docs/commands.md` for complete command reference.

## Architecture
<!-- GENERATED:setup:architecture start -->
Single-binary, single-process, single-user. All UI surfaces (systray, overlay, hotkey) are direct Win32 via `golang.org/x/sys/windows` — no `lxn/walk` (frozen), no CGO. A shared Win32 message pump dispatches `WM_HOTKEY`, overlay drag events, and tray menu interactions on one UI thread. Subsystems are isolated under `internal/{tray,overlay,hotkey,capture,clipboard,toast,config,log,status}`; each runs on its own goroutine where applicable, with errors funneled through `slog` to `logs/agent-latest.jsonl`.

## Critical Warnings
<!-- GENERATED:setup:warnings start -->
- **`CGO_ENABLED=0` is mandatory** in every build. CI fails loudly if it leaks to `1`. CGO breaks cross-compilation, requires MinGW, triggers Defender false-positives on unsigned binaries.
- **TOML config strict mode** rejects unknown keys — typos in `config.toml` cause `config.error` events at startup. Add new keys with care; deprecated keys must be removed cleanly.
- **Single instance enforced** via Windows named mutex `Global\ClipClapSingleInstance` — a second instance exits with `single_instance.violation`. Tests must clean up the prior process before launching a new one.
- **Clipboard reentry guard (500ms)** silently drops clipboard-change events from the app's own write — legitimate external clipboard activity in that window is also dropped. Documented trade-off; do not extend the window.
- **Status endpoint is loopback-only and `--agent-mode`-gated** (default off). It is a test hook, not a product API — never expose externally, never add auth, never proxy.

## Session Learnings
_This section is curated by `/wrap-session`. Learnings accumulated across work sessions will appear here. Do not edit directly during wrap-session runs — changes will be preserved but wrap-session appends new entries below._

- 2026-04-17: When the user has custom `/<skill>` commands available (`/implement`, `/andromeda-*`, `/wrap-session`, etc.) for a workflow, USE them instead of rolling your own execution path — even if the plan is clear and directly executable. User values pipeline consistency and the skills encode contract details (branch strategy, progress markers, Final-N verification recipes by project type, commit-prefix rules) that hand-rolled execution silently skips. Check available skills before proceeding. (confidence 0.9)
